			GreenTrade is the premier marketplace to sell your phone for great value with the convenience of having your phone picked up directly from your home!
		</div>
		<div class="get-text">
			Get the best value for your phone based on model and condition. Once you agree with our fair value
			offer for your unwanted phone you can arrange to get the phone picked up. Itâ€™s like having a personal
			chauffeur for your phone! (now that is service). Once we receive your phone in our warehouse we
			inspect the phone to ensure the condition is as you said it was and ba-da-boom we issue you
			a payment quicker than swiping right!
